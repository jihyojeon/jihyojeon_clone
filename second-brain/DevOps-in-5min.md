### Goal
make software development process successful

### Problems
Software team
- Development Team
	- idle feedback from ops team
- Operations Team
	- any re-work require

-> time require

### How to fix this?
what if DevOps(combining both) break the wall?

### What we can expect
- continuous process
- improve efficiency
- constant activity

### But
maybe there can be communication challenges
-> DevOps manages

---

### How it works
