*Quicksort* is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm that works by partitioning a list of items into two smaller sub-lists and then sorting each sub-list recursively. It gets its name from the way it chooses a pivot element from the list and "quickly" sorts the items around the pivot.

Here is a brief outline of the quicksort algorithm:

1.  Choose a pivot element from the list. This is often the first or last element, but any element can be used.
2.  Reorder the list so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot, and all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it. This is called partitioning.
3.  Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-list of elements with smaller values and the sub-list of elements with greater values.

The list will eventually be sorted when the base case is reached, which is when there is only one element in the sub-list. At this point, the algorithm can return and the sorted list will be reconstructed from the sorted sub-lists.

Quicksort is a very efficient algorithm, with a time complexity of O(n log n) on average. However, its worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), which can occur if the pivot is always chosen as the smallest or largest element in the list. This can be avoided by using a randomized version of quicksort, or by choosing the pivot carefully to avoid the worst-case scenario.

```JS

function quicksort(arr) {
  // base case: if the array has 0 or 1 elements, return it as-is
  if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;

  // choose a pivot element (typically the first or last element)
  let pivot = arr[arr.length - 1];

  // create left and right arrays
  let left = [];
  let right = [];

  // partition the array around the pivot element
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    if (arr[i] < pivot) {
      left.push(arr[i]);
    } else {
      right.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }

  // recursively sort the left and right arrays
  left = quicksort(left);
  right = quicksort(right);

  // return the sorted array
  return [...left, pivot, ...right];
}

```

This implementation uses the last element in the array as the pivot, but other pivot choices are also possible. The function partitions the array into two sub-arrays (left and right) based on the pivot, then recursively sorts the left and right arrays using the quicksort algorithm. The sorted left and right arrays are then combined with the pivot element to form the final sorted array.

To use this function, you can simply call it with an array as an argument, like this:

```JS
let sortedArray = quicksort([5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3]);
//This will return the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` as the result.
```
