## About

### Branching and merging
	Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches, entirely independent of each other. You can do:
	- Frictionless Context Switching
	- Role-Based  codelines
	- Feature Based Workflow
	- Disposable experimentation
	- etc.

### Small and fast
	Git is smaller and faster than SVN(another version control tool).
	
### Distributed
	Git Clone
	- Multiple Entire Backups
	- Any Workflow is possible
		- Subversion-style
		- integration manager
		- dictator and lieutenants

### Data assurance
	Ensure the cruptographic integrity of every bit of your code!
	with commit id, you can be sure that nothing in its history was changed.
	
### Staging area
	Staging before commit
	1. add to staging area
	2. commit to repository
	
### Free and open source
